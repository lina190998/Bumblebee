（Translated）Bumblebee Bot은 2D MMORPG 게임 '메이플스토리'를 위해 맞춤으로 개발된 외부 도구입니다. 이 도구는 '메이플스토리' 동남아 서버(MapleStorySEA)에서 내장된 거짓탐지기를 작동시키지 않습니다(테스트 완료). 그러나 다른 지역의 '메이플스토리'나 사설 서버에서는 테스트되지 않았습니다. 이 도구는 오픈 소스이며 무료로 사용할 수 있습니다.

- Polo portal / Especia portal currently doesn't work on DMT day as the banner is blocking the top timer used to differentiate portal type. Users are suggested to turn portal feature off in settings tab. 
- When launcing on multiple PCs, cannot use the same telegram bot, must create a new tg bot for each PC.
